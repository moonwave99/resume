# Hello!

I am [Diego Caponera][1], I live in **Hamburg** and I've done a lot of things web. At the moment I am teaching full-stack web development at [SPICED Academy][sa]. Whenever I have time I keep on building the [music player of my dreams][2] in [Electron][3]/[React/Redux][4]/[Typescript][6], and a [tool to help me expand my guitar knowledge][5]. My biggest passion is to play and write music 🎸 🎹 🎤.
