## Skills

### Frontend

- **React** with (typed) **redux** and tested with **jest** is my weapon of choice now;
- maintained a lot of **Backbone** apps in the past;
- didn't like **Angular** much;
- **jQuery** functional API still owning my 🖤;
- **CSS**, preprocessed in `SASS`/`Less`/`stylus`.

### Backend

- **node.js** adept since almost a decade now;
- wrote a lot of **PHP** in my formation years;
- the scarce encounters with **ruby** were very pleasant I have to admit.

### Build tools

- `webpack` nowadays;
- long time romance with `brunch.io`;
- `gulp` and `grunt` ring more than a bell of course;
- `babel`/`rollup`/`ES modules`...been through that as well.

### Toolchain

- everything `git`: github/gitlab, various workflows, PR, reviews.
- ticket systems: **Jira**, **Trello**, **Github issues**...

### Various

- **electron.js**;
- static website generation (proud of my [waffel][wfl]).
